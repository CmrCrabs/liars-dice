Five dice per player are used alongside dice cups for concealment.
Players take turns rolling a "hand" of dice under their cups and make a bid based on their observation.

A bid involves a player announcing a chosen face value and the number of dice they belive show that value.

Players can either raise the bid or challenge the previous bid during their turn. 
Raising the bid involves increasing the quantity of dice with a specified face value.

If challenged, all dice are revealed. 
If the bid is valid, the bidder wins;; otherwise, the challenger wins. 

The loser of a round loses one die, and the game continues until only one player retains a die or dice, declaring them the winner. 
The loser of the previous round initiates bidding for the next round, or the next player does so if the previous loser is eliminated.
